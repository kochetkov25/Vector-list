# VectorList Iterator Implementation in C++
## Project Overview
This project implements iterators for a custom container, `VectorList`, which stores data in a list of vectors. The main focus is on developing **constant iterators** (both forward and reverse).
## Problem Statement
In this task, the goal is to develop iterators for the `VectorList` container, which holds its data in a list of vectors. You are required to implement only constant iterators (both forward and reverse). The `append()` method, already implemented, ensures that the list of vectors does not contain any empty vectors.
